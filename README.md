# Silly Gallery Practice

## Project Overview

**Silly Gallery Practice** is a personal project where I will be adding and documenting my ongoing learning in React Native. This space serves as a practice lab where I can experiment with different features, test new ideas, and strengthen my skills using Expo and TypeScript. Each update reflects a new step in my learning journey within the React Native ecosystem. Any help is welcome.
## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Run your app on Android, iOS, and web platforms using Expo.
- **React Native Integration**: Utilize the robust React Native framework for building mobile applications.
- **TypeScript**: Enjoy type safety and improved developer experience with TypeScript.
- **Expo**: Simplify the development process with Expo's powerful tools and services.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tortillaa/silly-gallery-practice.git
   cd silly-gallery-practice
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

To start the development server and run the app, use the following commands:

- **Start the project**:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- **Run on Android**:
  ```bash
  npm run android
  ```

- **Run on iOS**:
  ```bash
  npm run ios
  ```

- **Run on Web**:

These commands leverage Expo to start the app on your desired platform. Ensure your environment is set up to run Android or iOS simulators/emulators if you choose to run on those platforms.
